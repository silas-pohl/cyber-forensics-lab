\noindent As part of the responsibility to maintain the security and integrity of the systems, an investigation to ascertain the nature and extent of the incident was initiated. The Haisy development test server, hosted at haisy.cs2lab.dsv.su.se, is a critical component of the infrastructure, supporting the ongoing development and testing of the Haisy system, which manages student data and academic records. Any compromise to this system could have significant ramifications for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.
\newline

\noindent This report documents our investigation into the potential network intrusion, with the objective of understanding the events leading up to the alert from CERT-SE, identifying any unauthorized access or malicious activity, and assessing the impact on our systems and data. By conducting a thorough analysis of the available evidence and applying appropriate forensic techniques, we aim to provide actionable insights to mitigate risks, enhance security measures, and prevent future incidents of this nature.
\newpage
\section{Methods}
Our investigation into the possible network intrusion targeting the Haisy development test server began with a thorough confirmation of the integrity of the provided evidence files: \texttt{haisy\_4000.pcap} and \texttt{haisy.raw}. We utilized their respective SHA1 and MD5 hash values to ensure that the files had not been altered or corrupted since their acquisition.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\vspace{-0.8cm}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}
\vspace{-0.3cm}

\noindent We proceeded to analyze the \texttt{haisy\_4000.pcap} file using a Kali 2024.1 virtual machine (VM) equipped with Wireshark 4.2.2. Our primary goal was to gain insight into the network traffic associated with the suspected intrusion. We began our analysis by identifying the number of IP addresses involved in the traffic and examining the source and destination IP addresses. We also attempted to determine which ports were experiencing the highest volume of traffic, which would provide insight into the nature of the communication. We also used the geolocation tool \texttt{https://www.geodatatool.com/en/} to determine the geographic location of the identified IP addresses. This contextual information helped us understand the potential origin or source of the suspicious network activity. Throughout our analysis, we meticulously examined DNS and HTTP packets, as well as TCP streams, looking for any indicators of compromise or anomalous behavior that might indicate an attempted network intrusion.

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}
\vspace{-0.3cm}

\noindent We then turned our attention to examining the \texttt{haisy.raw} file in a Windows 10 environment running Autopsy 4.21.0. The goal of this phase of the investigation was to delve deeper into the system-level activity during the incident. Our analysis covered several key areas, including user account management, command execution, and software usage. We began by identifying existing users on the system and examining their account activity for signs of unauthorized access or suspicious behavior. At the same time, we analyzed the commands executed during the relevant time period to identify any anomalies or indicators of malicious activity. In addition, we evaluated the services running on the system at the time of the incident to assess their relevance to the investigation and potential impact on system security. To supplement our analysis, we examined specific log files associated with the running services, focusing on events and activities that could provide evidence of a potential attack or compromise. By meticulously reviewing the system logs, we aimed to uncover any traces of unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or suspicious activity indicative of a network intrusion. Finally, we synthesized the results to construct a comprehensive timeline of events related to the suspected intrusion. This timeline provided a chronological sequence of activities leading up to and during the incident, allowing us to gain a clear understanding of the nature and scope of the attempted intrusion.

\begin{verbatim}
$ sha1sum haisy_4000.pcap             
5d50246cd8ed94b9d39d60b4008a2ead1e3cba50  haisy_4000.pcap

$ md5sum haisy_4000.pcap 
8f7f17adf4de26e88dd2841dca174b02  haisy_4000.pcap

$ ls -l haisy_4000.pcap 
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali 35116793 Apr 23 08:20 haisy_4000.pcap
\end{verbatim}
The verification of the SHA1 and MD5 hash values of the evidence file \texttt{haisy\_4000.pcap} has shown that the file had not been altered or corrupted since its acquisition because the hash values match the values specified in the instructions. The file has a size of 35.1168MB.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Statistics $>$ Endpoints $>$ IPv4}
\label{screen:ip_addresses}
\end{figure}

\noindent The file \texttt{haisy\_4000.pcap} contains 300338 captured network packets in total and 13 unique IP addresses occur. Of these IP addresses, 10.11.8.18 (146k transmitted packets, 151k received packets), 37.120.246.146 (137k transmitted packets, 137k received packets), 10.11.2.22 (14k transmitted packets, 8k received packets), 10.11.8.17 (129 transmitted packets, 129 received packets), 209.51.188.174 (113 transmitted packets, 64 received packets) and 130.237.157.97 (8 transmitted packets, 140 received packets) generated the most traffic. The two internal IP addresses that occur most frequently (10.11.8.18 and 10.11.2.22) are the Linux server hosting \url{haisy.cs2lab.dsv.su.se} and the reverse proxy. The top five ports for Linux server (10.11.8.18) are 80, 59808, 42250, 44779, 44216 and for the reverse proxy (10.11.2.22) are 33688, 42598, 49402, 39140, 48330. The only port used for 37.120.246.146 is 60836. 
\newline

\noindent The three most common external IPs can be traced back geographically to Romania, Bucharest (37.120.246.146), United States, Boston (209.51.188.174) and Sweden, Stockholm (130.237.157.97).
\newline

\noindent When looking at the DNS related packets, it is noticeable that attempts were made to call domains that do not exist. For example, attempts were made to call up www.daisy.dsv.su.se or www.daisy.dsv.su.se.cs2lab.dsv.su.se. Domains such as fr.wikipedia.org or fsf.org, which have nothing directly to do with the daisy service, were called. In addition, there are DNS queries resolving to CNAME records such as mimas.dsv.su.se. CNAME records are used to alias one name to another. The presence of CNAME records isn't unusual, but it's important to verify that these canonical names are legitimate and expected within the network environment.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{http_traffic.png}

\caption{Filter "http"}
\label{screen:http_traffic}
\end{figure}

\noindent When looking at the HTTP traffic, it is noticeable that many GET requests were made to url paths that do not exist. For example, attempts were made to call \url{/iissamples/issamples/fastq.idq?CiTemplate=../../../../../../../../../../../../winnt/win.ini}, \url{/readme.html} or \url{/admin.html} on the Linux server (10.11.8.18). This could be a sign that an attacker tried a directory/path traversal attack.

\end{verbatim}
The verification of the SHA1 and MD5 hash values of \texttt{haisy.raw} has shown that the file had not been altered or corrupted since its acquisition because the hash values match the values specified in the instructions. The file has a size of 16.1061GB. The image contains 5 partitions and the operating system according to the lsb-release file is Ubuntu 13.10 codename saucy.

\end{verbatim}
\noindent The file \texttt{etc/passwd} contains entries for 29 user accounts whereby a home directory exists only for the user erika. The \texttt{.bash\_history} of the user erika reveals several activities that could be considered suspicious:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Repeated SSH Service Commands (\texttt{sudo /etc/init.d/ssh status, sudo status  /etc/i\\nit.d/ssh, sudo start  /etc/init.d/ssh, sudo  /etc/init.d/ssh}): The frequent stopping, starting, and status checking of the SSH service could indicate trouble with the SSH service, or it might suggest that someone was trying to gain persistent access.
	\item Network Interface Cycling (\texttt{sudo ifconfig eth0 down, sudo ifconfig eth0 up, ...}): Regularly bringing the network interface eth0 down and back up is unusual and could be an attempt to evade network monitoring or reset network connections after unauthorized activities.
	\item Bypassing SSL Certificate Verification (\texttt{wget --no-check-certificate http://daisy.dsv.\\su.se, wget --no-check-certificate dsv.su.se, ...}): The use of --no-check-certificate with wget could suggest And HTTP (no encryption) is used.
	\item Editing Apache Configuration Files (\texttt{nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, cd /etc/apache2/, nano apache2.conf, ...}): Changes to the Apache configuration could be legitimate, but they can also indicate an attempt to alter the web server's behavior for malicious purposes, such as setting up a reverse proxy for traffic redirection.
	\item Direct Interaction with MySQL Database (\texttt{mysql -u erika -p < haisy\_students\_2023.sql, mysql -u root -p haisy < haisy\_students\_2023.sql, ...}): Importing/exporting data using the MySQL command line with root access can be a standard administrative task, but it can also be a way to inject malicious data or exfiltrate information.
\end{itemize}
